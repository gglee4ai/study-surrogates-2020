LGBB is a rocket booster concept developed at NASA/Langley.

An initial computer experiment using Euler solver and distributed
computing to explore the relationship between speed (mach), angle of
attack (alpha), slide-slip angle (beta) on six aeronautically relevant
outputs (lift, drag, etc.)  upon re-entry of the LGBB into the
atmosphere.  For more information, please see:

Computers". Rogers, S. E., Aftosmis, M. J., Pandya, S. A.,
N. M. Chaderjian, E. T. T., and Ahmad, J. U. (2003).  In 16th AIAA

The file lgbb_original.txt corresponds to the above experiment.  An
iteratively hand-crafted gridding (settings of mach, alpha, and beta),
focused most of the inputs near mach=1 and large alpha.  Due to poor
detection of convergence in the Euler solver in this initial
experiment, the six responses (lift, drag, ...) appear "noisy".

An automated and adaptive sequential design methodology was developed
around the Bayesian treed Gaussian proceses (GP) as a surrogate model.
Please see:

"Bayesian treed Gaussian process models with an application to
computer modeling".  Robert B. Gramacy and Herbert K. H. Lee. (2008)
Journal of the American Statistical Association, 103(483),
pp. 1119-1130; arXiv:0710.5837

Adaptive sampling combines classical sequential design strategies and
active learning techniques.  Proof of concept adaptive sampling
experiments with the treed GP used the gridded data and responses
(lgbb_original.txt) instead of the real Euler solver.  Please see:

B. Gramacy, Herbert K. H. Lee, and William G. MacReady. (2004)
Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning, pp
353-360, Omnipress and ACM Digital Library (see ams2004-04.pdf)

Later, a real experiment was sequentially designed on NASA's columbia
supercomputer using a custom AeroDB interface to the Euler solvers,
and driven by the treed GP adaptive sampling methodology.

In addition to the automated and adaptive sequential design, the
experiments used an updated version of the Euler solver, and a more
robust convergence detection algorithm.  The file lgbb_as.txt contains
the 780 adaptively sampled locations.  The rows are arranged in the
order that they were adaptive sampled. Adaptive samples were selected
from the dense 3-d grid of 37908 locations listed in
lgbb_as_planned.txt, and the file lgbb_as_rest.txt contains the
remaining unused (37128) grid locations.
